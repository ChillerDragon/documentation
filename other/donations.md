# Donations

As we all know, there are no such things such as free lunches -- or free game projects. During the course of development, we've all paid out of our own pockets to bring you the game you all know and love. In spirit with keeping the game a completely free experience, we've added a discreet donate-o-matic widget to the page. In order to regain some of the expenses, we're now accepting donations.

To get a quick overview of our financial status, just check out the progress bar in the widget, along with a brief legend of the economic milestones. The donation page will also have up-to-date information of what the donated funds will be financing, along with any overhead.

### FAQ

- **Q: How do I get the donor badge in the forum?**
- **A**: If you used the same email when you donated as you have on the forum, we will change it automatically when we accept the donation. If you have different emails, send an email to info@teeworlds.com with both your email addresses in the body and we will make the change. Please note that all this is done by manual labour so it depends on when we check the account. Usually we do this daily.
