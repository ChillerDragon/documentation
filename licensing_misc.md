# Licensing, Modifications and Donations

## The License

- It complies to the OSI definition: http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php
- It complies with Debian Free Software Guidelines: http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#s-dfsg
- The license is the result of a week long discussion with input from a license expert at Fedora.
- The whole OSS thing have started to take more time then it's actually worth.
- No, it will not get changed because you complain.

## Modifications

Modifications are not our responsibility.

Modified servers, however, must not broadcast themselves under the name of one of the official gametypes, and abide by other common-sense [Server Rules](rules/server_rules.md).

Has to be done in 3rd person :)

## Donations

Thanks to your generosity, we have enough resources to keep the current infrastructure (website, masterservers) running for long, and have stopped accepting donations.
