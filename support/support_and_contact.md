When any of the IRC channels, be sure to read the [IRC Channel Rules](../rules/irc_rules.md).

### Support

If you run into troubles with running Teeworlds, there is a section in the forum called [Support](http://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewforum.php?id=4) were you can get help from other players and from the developers. There is also an IRC channel on the Quakenet network called #teeworlds for general chatter and support.

### Development and supplying patches

If you want to help with the development, we suggest that you start at [Hacking](../hacking.md).

### The contact e-mail

The contact@teeworlds.com email address is intended for serious business only. We will not give support related to running the game, server hosting, compiling the game, etc. Take those questions in the forum.
