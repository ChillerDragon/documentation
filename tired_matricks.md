# Why I wont discuss these subjects

All people have a limited amount of time. As I'm almost the only coder on the game I would like to spend my time improving the game instead of dealing with questions that I've discussed over and over again.

## The License

- It complies to the OSI definition: http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php
- It complies with Debian Free Software Guidelines: http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#s-dfsg
- The license is the result of a week long discussion with input from a license expert at Fedora.
- The whole OSS thing have started to take more time then it's actually worth.
- No, it will not get changed because you complain.

## Modded Servers

I don't care about modded servers, they are not my responsibility.

Has to be done in 3rd person :)
