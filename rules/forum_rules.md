# Forum Rules

These are the rules and the moderation guidelines for the forum. Note that moderators may always take any action they deem necessary, considering the circumstances. Breaking a rule is always a bannable offense.

---

### Before posting

1. **Use the search function**
	* Chances are your issue has already been addressed.
2. **Never post the same topic in two or more forums**

The thread in the least relevant forum will be deleted.
### When posting

Breaking these rules will most likely result in a warning.

1. **Write in English -- No exceptions!**
	* Non-english posts will be deleted.
2. **Post in the correct forum**
	* Threads will be moved to an appropriate forum.
3. **Write clear and concise topics**
	* Moderators may edit topics to clarify questions or delete them entirely.
4. **Don't post or link to offensive/pornographic/illegal material, or cheats**
	* Threads and posts will be immediately closed. Breaking this rule will very likely result in a ban.
5. **Respect the other forum members, moderators and developers**
	* Moderators may delete offensive posts and ban users at their leisure.
6. **Stay on topic**
	* Spam, "me too"-posts and similar content of low information value may be deleted. *This includes memes*.

### Forum Moderation

1. **Use the report function**
	* Do NOT add to the fire by commenting on the offending post. You're just adding to the problem, and you'll risk a warning or a ban.
2. **Do not discuss moderation publicly**
	* Any issues with moderation should be resolved by PM:ing the moderator, or contacting him / her on IRC. Posts concerning moderation will be removed.
3. **Moderators have final say in all matters**
	* Remember the golden rule: Moderators are always right, even when they're wrong.
