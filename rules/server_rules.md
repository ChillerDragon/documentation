# Server Rules

After some issues with mods, this ruleset has been established for servers in the server list:

- A modified Teeworlds server must not use a standard gametype (dm, tdm, ctf, lms, lts)
- _0.6.x and previous_: The player count shown must resemble the amount of human players. The maximum player count must be the maximum number of human players.
- _0.7.x and later_: You can also include non-human players using a special bot flag. This allows client-side filtering.
- Do not host an excessive amount of servers. There is no fixed limit but try to not overdo it. (i.e. there should be people playing on them eventually)
- Do not host servers purely for advertising purposes (e.g. passworded & having only an advertisement as name; having sponsoring info or the likes in the server name is perfectly fine).

Servers violating this ruleset will be banned.

You can check out the list of masterserver bans at [https://teeworlds.com/master-bans.cfg](https://teeworlds.com/master-bans.cfg) if you have any doubt.

If you wish to be notified about problems with your server(s) you may provide a contact email address in your MOTD.
